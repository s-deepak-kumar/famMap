# famMap
famMap is the one type of tracker app where you can connect with your family, friends & colleague and see them on real maps. Here you can also search places with address or place type (Restaurent, Hospitals etc.). famMap gives you flexibility and good user experience.

I used tools that make it easy to get right into what matters: creating a native android application that people want to use. I develop this whole app using Java, Android Studio & Google Maps SDK & APIs.
